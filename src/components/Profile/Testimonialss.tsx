    title: "Annapurna Base Camp Helicopter Tour With Knowledgeable And Friendly Crew",
    review: "I had always dreamed of trekking to Annapurna Base Camp, but I wasn't sure if I had the time or fitness level to do it. When I found out about the Annapurna Base Camp Helicopter Tour, I knew it was the perfect solution. The tour with Green Valley Nepal Treks exceeded my expectations. The helicopter ride was smooth and comfortable, and the views were simply stunning..",

    title: "Absolute Best - Everest Base Camp Trek",
    review: "I thoroughly enjoyed my trek to Everest base camp with Green valley. All the arrangements were made really well. As I was traveling alone, I wanted to go with a trekking company that was responsive, and Arjun was super responsive even from day 1. He was very accommodating to the extent that I had not paid advance and he had still made all the arrangements for me.",
